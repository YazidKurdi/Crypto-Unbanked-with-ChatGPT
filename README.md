# Crypto-Unbanked-with-ChatGPT

While reading [Lyn Alden](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact)'s [December Newsletter](https://www.lynalden.com/december-2022-newsletter/), the below snippet caught my eye.
<br>
From the top 20 countries in crypto adoption (2022) provided by [Chain Analysis](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/), is there a correlation in a specific country between crypto adoption and the percentage of people banked (2021) using the [Global Economy Index](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/)?
<br>
<br>
With the help of ChatGPT I was able to webscrape country names provided in the textbox [Here](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/), as well as the crypto adoption provided by Chain Analysis in their blog. Run a script on all the countries to retrieve their respective population banked percentage.
Visualize the findings using power BI.
